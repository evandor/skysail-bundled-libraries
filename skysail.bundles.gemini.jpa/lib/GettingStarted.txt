Getting Started with Gemini JPA 
--------------------------------

Gemini JPA implements the OSGi JPA specification. It uses EclipseLink as the JPA provider.

Required Bundles
----------------

To run Gemini JPA in OSGi you will need to have the following:

1. OSGi Framework

You may use any OSGi r4.3 compliant framework. Equinox 3.7 may be used within Eclipse through PDE,
or on its own in standalone mode. Felix 4.0 has also been tested.

2. OSGi Enterprise API bundle

Gemini JPA implements some of the OSGi Enterprise APIs so the osgi.enterprise bundle must be resident.
This bundle includes both the source and the class files so it can be used for both execution and debugging.
The Gemini DBAccess download includes this bundle as part of its download, or it can be downloaded from
the OSGi web site: http://www.osgi.org/Download/Release4V42

3. Gemini DBAccess (Optional)

While you don't strictly require Gemini DBAccess to run Gemini JPA it is highly recommended. It renders 
your application much more modular. The actual bundles you need depend upon the database you are using. 
If DBAccess is not present you will need to package the JDBC driver JAR in the persistence unit bundle and 
set the bundle classpath of the bundle to include the JAR.

4. EclipseLink bundles

The following EclipseLink bundles are required:

- javax.persistence
- org.eclipse.persistence.asm
- org.eclipse.persistence.antlr
- org.eclipse.persistence.core
- org.eclipse.persistence.jpa

These bundles must be from EclipseLink 2.3.0 GA or later. 

Note: Do *NOT* use the org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.osgi or any of the weaving bundles shipped with EclipseLink.

5. Gemini JPA bundles

Gemini JPA is composed of a single bundle: org.elipse.gemini.jpa. 
This bundle contains all of the Gemini JPA supporting classes.

An additional samples bundle is also part of the distribution. 

Installation
------------

If running in PDE then unzip the files into a directory and import the various projects into your workspace, 
or even better, create a target platform with all of the bundles in it.
If you are using the framework directly then unzip the distribution files and follow the documentation of
the framework for installing the bundles described above. Note that the osgi.enterprise bundle has an
optional dependency on the javax.persistence package (exported by the EclipseLink bundle of that name), which 
is not optional when using the JPA classes.

Configuration
-------------

Gemini JPA does not require any special environment configuration, however, ensure that the javax.persistence 
and DBAccess bundles have been started before any applications.
